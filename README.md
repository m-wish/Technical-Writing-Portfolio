# Technical Writing Portfolio
Welcome to my Technical Writing portfolio! I'm **Marisa Wish**, an aspiring technical writer with a bachelor's degree in **computer science** and previous studies in **English education**. With my combined experience in coding, writing, and technical documentation, I aim to support development teams by aiding and improving user understanding of complex technical concepts. 

This portfolio showcases examples of technical writing and documentation work that I have completed throughout the course of my studies, including:
- **Process Documentation** based on real workflows
- **README files** for various coding projects
- **Sample Code Documentation** from small programs
- **User Guides** for installations and executions of projects

Each sample showcases my focus on clarity, structure, and conciseness in technical communication.
