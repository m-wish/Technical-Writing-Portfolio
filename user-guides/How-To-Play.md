# How To Play

### Story:
You are a **Private Investigator** called to the Hotel Beauvoir to find a **missing red key**. You enter the hotel through its lobby and meet **Bertram, the hotel manager**, who informs you that the key opens his office. Your objective is to **search the hotel**, speaking to its various occupants and opening various chests to gather items along the way, and **find the missing red key**. If you irritate enough of the hotel's occupants, you will be fired. To win, you must bring the key down to the office and **unlock the office door**.

### To Win:
Unlock the office door with the red key.

### To Lose:
Have **at most *TWO*** negative interactions with the hotel occupants. After this, your reputation is ruined, and you are fired.

### To Play:
There are a total of **EIGHT different actions** available to take. If an action is unavailable, such as not having an item in your inventory that is required to complete an action, it will not appear as an option.

- **UNLOCK DOOR**: If the door is locked and you have the proper key, you will be able to use your key to unlock the door by typing  **U**  (unlock door) when prompted. After unlocking the door, you will be presented with the option to walk through it.
- **BREAK DOWN DOOR**: If the door is blocked and you have the axe, you will be able to use your axe to unlock the door by typing  **A**  (break door) when prompted. After breaking down the door, you will be presented with the option to walk through it.
- **OPEN CHEST**: Inside a chest are items that you can take to help you in your search, such as green keys and an axe. You can open a chest by typing  **C** (open chest) when prompted. After taking the items, you will not be able to access the chest again.
- **TALK**: Some rooms have occupants. You can speak to them at any time when you are in their room. They present you with a choice, or ask you a question, and if you answer correctly, they give their item to you. Answer incorrectly and you offend them, and your reputation as a private investigator takes a hit.
- **GO NORTH**: To move to a north room, type  **N**  when prompted.
- **GO EAST**: To move to an east room, type  **E**  when prompted.
- **GO SOUTH**: To move to a south room, type  **S**  when prompted.
- **GO WEST**: To move to a west room, type  **W**  when prompted.
